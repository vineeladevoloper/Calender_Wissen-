Here's a complete breakdown of the **approach we followed** to build a dynamic, country-specific holiday calendar app with **highlighted weeks based on holiday density**.

---

## ✅ Goal

Build a **React-based calendar** that:

* Shows **public holidays** per country
* Fetches real-time data from a **Universal Holiday API**
* Highlights entire weeks:

  * **Light Green**: 1 or fewer holidays
  * **Dark Green**: more than 1 holiday
* Works across month boundaries (e.g., Dec 31 + Jan 1 = same week)

---

## 🧱 Features Implemented

### 1. **Base Calendar UI**

* Grid layout using TailwindCSS
* `MonthWiseCalendar` for monthly layout
* Days of the week as headers
* Proper padding for days before the month starts

### 2. **Week Highlighting Logic**

* Calculate all weeks that span a month, including overflow days from the **previous or next month**
* For each week:

  * Count how many days have a holiday
  * Apply background:

    * `bg-green-200/20` if ≤ 1 holiday
    * `bg-green-800/20` if > 1 holiday

### 3. **Dynamic Holiday Fetching**

* Integrated **Nager.Date Public Holiday API**
* URL format:

  ```
  https://date.nager.at/api/v3/PublicHolidays/{year}/{countryCode}
  ```
* Fetch holiday data whenever:

  * `country` changes
  * `year` changes
* Parsed and mapped data into format:

  ```js
  { date: "2025-12-25", title: "Christmas" }
  ```

### 4. **Country Selector**

* Dropdown with 10 countries
* Country stored as ISO code (`US`, `IN`, `GB`, etc.)
* Controlled component triggers holiday API fetch

### 5. **Month Navigation**

* `<` and `>` buttons to change month
* Automatically handles:

  * Year transition (e.g., Dec ➡ Jan)
  * Updates holiday coloring for the new view

### 6. **Holiday Overlay**

* Each calendar cell shows:

  * The date
  * Any holiday(s) occurring that day
  * A green dot indicator if it's "today"

---

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. **User selects country** → triggers API call for holidays
2. API returns all holidays for that year
3. Holidays are filtered for the selected **month**
4. Group all visible days into **weeks**
5. Count holidays per week → set background color
6. Render calendar UI with:

   * Day numbers
   * Holiday title overlays
   * Highlighted week backgrounds

## 🧠 Advanced Considerations

| Area           | Detail                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💾 Caching     | Use `localStorage` or IndexedDB to store fetched holidays |
| 🚀 Performance | Memoize holiday mapping and week rendering                |
| 🌐 CORS        | Use a proxy server if needed (Nager doesn't require one)  |
| 🎯 Edge Cases  | Dec 31 + Jan 1 in same week, cross-month coloring handled |
| 🔐 API Key     | Not needed for Nager API (good for dev/demo)              |

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

| Tool        | Purpose                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| React       | UI logic and reactivity  |
| TailwindCSS | Styling and layout       |
| date-fns    | Date manipulation        |
| Nager API   | Real holiday data source |
| React Icons | Navigation icons         |

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

You now have a:

* **Dynamic calendar** with real holiday data
* **Country-aware UI**
* **Month and year navigation**
* **Week-level background coloring** across months
* **Scalable architecture** for adding features like:

  * Year view
  * Custom user events
  * Reminders or notifications

Let me know if you'd like:

* Backend caching proxy (Node.js/Spring Boot)
* Offline support with local DB
* Integration with Google Calendar or Outlook

You're on a solid path, Vineeth 👌
